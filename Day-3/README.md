##Simulating Coin Flips

Grab the starter file [coin flips.py](coin flips.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

The goal of the program is to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times. It uses a function flip_coin() that is incomplete. It's your job to finish it.

Here is another example program that uses a function: [tip calculator.py](tip calculator.py)

Here is one approach to building your function:
* Pick a random number between 1 and 2 (where have you done this before?)
* If the random number is 1 return heads. Else return tails. (where have you done an if/else?)

This line of code is how you can return heads:

    return "heads"

That's it! Test it out and see how many times can your program flip a coin a second.

##Simulating Dice Rolls

Grab the starter file [dice rolls.py](dice rolls.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

This program uses an array named totals. An array is a variable that remembers a list of info in specific slots (the slots start counting at 0).
