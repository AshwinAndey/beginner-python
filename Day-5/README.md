##PyGame Animation

Grab the starter file [animation.py](animation.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

Download the image [beach_ball.png](beach_ball.png) and save it in the same location as your Python file.

Try running it!

If you receive the error: 

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:/Python25/pygame tester.py", line 16, in <module>
        my_ball = pygame.image.load('beach_ball.png')
    error: Couldn't open beach_ball.png
    
Then your image file was not saved in the correct location!
